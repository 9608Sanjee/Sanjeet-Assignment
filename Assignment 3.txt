#1 Explain the significance of Python keywords and provide examples of five keywords ?

Python keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the Python language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) because they are already predefined for specific tasks within Python code. Understanding and using Python keywords correctly is essential for writing efficient and readable code.

Here are examples of five Python keywords along with their significance:

1.if: The if keyword is used to perform conditional execution in Python. It allows you to specify a block of code to be executed only if a specified condition is true.

Example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
2.for: The for keyword is used to iterate over elements of a sequence (such as lists, tuples, or strings) or other iterable objects. It simplifies the process of looping through items.

Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
3.def: The def keyword is used to define a function in Python. It marks the beginning of the function definition block.

Example:
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
4.return: The return keyword is used inside a function to exit the function and return a value to the caller. It also optionally passes back a value or multiple values.

Example:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
5.class: The class keyword is used to define a new class in Python. It is used to create user-defined data structures that contain both data and methods.

Example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says woof!")
 
 #2 Descri0e the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example ?
 
 
In Python, identifiers are names given to various elements in the code, such as variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these elements and provide a way to reference them within the code. Here are the rules for defining identifiers in Python:

1.Allowed characters: Identifiers can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.

2.Case sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct. For example, my_variable and My_Variable are treated as different identifiers.

3.Reserved words: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords or reserved words. These keywords have predefined meanings and purposes within the Python language and cannot be used as identifiers.

4.Length: There is no maximum limit on the length of an identifier in Python. However, it's recommended to keep identifiers reasonably short and descriptive for better code readability.

5.Special characters: Except for underscores (_), Python does not allow special characters such as @, $, %, etc., in identifiers.

Here's an example demonstrating the rules for defining identifiers in Python:
# Valid identifiers
variable_name = 10
MyVariable = "Hello"
my_variable_2 = 3.14
_underscore_variable = True

#3 What are comments in Python, and why are they useful6 Provide an example ?

Comments in Python are annotations within the code that are ignored by the interpreter during execution. They are used to add explanations, documentation, or notes to the code for better readability and understanding. Comments are essential for making the code more maintainable and for communicating with other developers who may read or work with the code.

Here are some reasons why comments are useful in Python:

1.Documentation: Comments can provide explanations of what the code does, how it works, and why certain decisions were made. This helps other developers (and yourself in the future) understand the code more easily.

2.Clarification: Comments can clarify complex or obscure parts of the code, making it easier to follow the logic and reasoning behind certain implementations.

#4 Why is proper indentation important in Python ?

Proper indentation in Python is vital for code readability and structure. It visually organizes code blocks, facilitating quick comprehension of program flow. Python's interpreter enforces indentation, ensuring syntactic correctness. Consistent indentation fosters collaboration, maintains code clarity, and clearly delineates nested structures. Overall, it is essential for clean, readable, and error-free Python code.

#5 What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python ?

If indentation is incorrect in Python, it can lead to indentation errors (IndentationError) during code execution. Python relies on indentation to define the structure of code blocks such as loops, conditional statements, function definitions, and class definitions. Incorrect indentation can cause the interpreter to misinterpret the code structure, resulting in syntax errors or unexpected behavior. Therefore, proper indentation is crucial for ensuring the syntactic correctness and proper execution of Python code.

#6 Differentiate 0etween expression and statement in Python with examples ?

Expression:

* An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value.
* It can be simple, like a single variable, or complex, like a mathematical expression or a function call.
* Expressions can appear within statements, and they can also be standalone entities.

Statement:

* A statement is a complete unit of execution that performs some action.
* It can be simple, like an assignment or a function call, or complex, like a loop or conditional statement.
*Statements often contain expressions, but they can also include keywords and other language constructs.
